## Background ##
Starbucks was founded in 1971 in Seattle, Washington, by three partners: Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker where initially high-quality coffee beans and equipment were sold rather than brewed coffee. In 1982, Howard Schultz joined the company and, inspired by Italian coffeehouses, transformed Starbucks into a coffeehouse chain serving espresso-based drinks. Schultz acquired the company in 1987, expanding rapidly beyond Seattle, including international markets. Starbucks went public in 1992, fuelling further growth and innovation, e.g. the Frappuccino and in-store Wi-Fi and mobile apps. Today, Starbucks operates over 30,000 stores worldwide, known for its premium coffee, commitment to sustainability, and continuous innovation.
The Starbucks mobile app enhances customer convenience by allowing users to place orders in advance, make payments, and customise their drinks. Integrated with the Starbucks Rewards program, the app lets users earn and redeem stars for free items. It also features a store locator, provides menu and nutritional information, and offers personalised promotions. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.

## Project Overview ##

The goal is to determine which offer should be sent based off of previous responses provided to previous offers. Not every single user receives the same offers. To resolve this problem, the data provided by Starbucks i.e. the json files will be utilised and I will then construct a machine learning model in order to provide predicts to the responses for customer offerings.
